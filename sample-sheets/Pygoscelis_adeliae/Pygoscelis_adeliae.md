# Pygoscelis adeliae

Common name: Adelie penguin
IUCN Red List information: [Adelie penguin](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22697758/157660553)

## Census size information
Population size (IUCN): 10,000,000
Trend (IUCN): Increasing; least concern

IUCN text:
"The total global population was previously estimated at c.2.37 million breeding pairs (range 1.83-2.88 million pairs), equating to 4.74 million breeding individuals, based on survey data collated up to the mid-1990s (Woehler 1993, Woehler and Croxall 1997). More recently, Lynch and La Rue (2014) estimated the global breeding population to be 3.79 million pairs (range 3.52-4.10 million pairs) spread amongst 190-250 colonies (depending on the definition of a colony), equating to 7.58 million breeding individuals, based largely on satellite imagery of breeding colonies obtained between 2006 and 2011. These estimates do not include mature individuals that have skipped breeding in a season, which have been estimated to comprise up to 20% of the total breeding-age population (Southwell et al. 2017), nor pre-breeding individuals (the species not beginning to breed until an average of 4-5 years; Ainley 2002). The global population of breeding-aged individuals is thus likely to be around 10 million mature individuals; the total population including both mature and pre-breeding birds is around 14-16 million individuals (Southwell et al. 2017)."

## Range information
From Birds of the World:
"Circumpolar in S; largely restricted to Antarctica."

Estimated extent of occurrence (IUCN): 21000000 km2

## Other Factors

Generation length: 12.7 years
Movement patterns: Full migrant (IUCN); Dispersive (BoTW)

IUCN text:
"Patterns of movement are well-known for adults during breeding, with foraging within 10-180 km of the coast depending upon colony size (Ballance et al. 2009). Foraging trips can be as far as 380 km during the incubation period (Clarke et al. 2006). During the non-breeding period, adults move into the pack-ice up to 1,000-2,500 km from the breeding colony, depending upon the distance to the sea ice edge (e.g. Clarke et al. 2003, Ballard et al. 2010, Dunn et al. 2011, Hinke et al. 2015, Takahashi et al. 2018, Thiebot et al. 2019, Warwick-Evans et al. 2019). In most cases, this involves moving to the north, although individuals in the northern Antarctic Peninsula shift east or west, and those of the central western Antarctic Peninsula shift south; previously, when winter sea ice was more persistent, there was little movement, with many individuals remaining in the vicinity of their colony sites year round (Parmelee et al. 1977)."

BoTW:
"after breeding birds move N towards rich feeding grounds..movements during winter months were closely related to movement patterns of sea ice, which were, in turn, influenced by oceanic currents and wind, and the researchers suggested that large gyral oceanic systems provide a means for penguins to reduce costs of transport as they move into regions of high productivity in winter and return to colonies in spring"

Mass (birds of the world): 3.8-8.2 kg

## Sample Sheet Construction

For this project, we'll exclude the captive trio from SeaWorld, but use all other individuals.
