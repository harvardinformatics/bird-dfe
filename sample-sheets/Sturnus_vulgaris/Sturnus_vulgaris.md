# Sturnus vulgaris

Common name: European starling
IUCN Red List information: [Common starling](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22710886/137493608)

## Census size information
Population size (IUCN): 150,000,000
Trend (IUCN): Decreasing; least concern

Population size (BotW): 200,000,000 in North America, based on 10-20 pairs/km2; may represent 1/3 of global population, implying ~600,000,000 total

IUCN text:
"The global population is estimated to number 150,000,000 mature individuals (A. Panjabi in litt. 2017). The population in Europe, which forms approximately 55% of the global range, is estimated at 28,800,000-52,400,000 pairs, equating to 57,700,000-105,000,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015)."

"Trend Justification: In Europe, the population has been undergoing a moderate decline between 1980 and 2015 (EBCC 2018). Likewise, the introduced population in North America has declined between 1970 and 2014 (51% decline between 1966 and 2015 based on the North American Breeding Bird Survey [Sauer et al. 2017]). Therefore, the global population is tentatively assessed as being in decline."

## Range information
From Birds of the World:
"The native breeding range of the European Starling covers much of Eurasia, from the British Isles and Scandinavia south to France, central Italy, the Middle East, and east to Lake Baikal, with the wintering range extending into n. Africa (Feare 1984c). Some areas (e.g. Iceland, n. and w. Europe) have been recently (twentieth century) colonized by population expansion.

In addition, starlings have been introduced in a number of areas, allowing for rapid population expansion and colonization. These areas include North America, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and adjacent islands, Jamaica, and some of the West Indies (Lever 1987)."

Estimated extent of occurrence (IUCN): 33200000 km2

## Other Factors

Generation length: 4.6 years

Mass (birds of the world): 83.8 g (males), 79.4 g (females); depending on time of year mean mass ranges from 81-88g for males and 77-82g for females

Resequencing samples are in [PRJNA935977](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA935977/), [publication](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/40/3/msad046/7052962)

Resequencing includes three main locations: Australia (eight sampling sites), North America (New York), United Kingdom (Newcastle upon Tyne). Only a subset of the Australian individuals (labeled au09-au33 in paper) are releasted in PRJNA935977. The remainder are in PRJNA938765, associated with [this publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.19.442026v1.full).
